                                present and fictional world-building. As a former architect, her research focuses on the intangible
                                shaping from urbanization process on collective memory, while also examining the tangible influence
                                of neural mechanisms on individual memory. Obsessed with experimental pipelines that combine
                                cutting-edge 3D scanning technolog with CGI software, game engines and generative AI, she creates
                                immersive and interactive experiences to record, represent, and critically reflect on memory.
