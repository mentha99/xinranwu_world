                            dilapidated lane communities that are being demolished. Gong'an Lane is one of them. With
                            the persuasion of government, residents moved out from their old houses and moved to the
                            suburbs to start a new life.

                            outdoor air-conditioning units is a parking shed spontaneously built by residents. Among
                            this chaos, the blooming flowers on the windowsil add a lovely touch to the facade.

                            a garden, rendering a sense of greenery in this community.

                            As the culminating output of my survey, I compiled a booklet featuring my technical drawings
                            and evocative sketches. To enrich the connection with the community, I revisited House
                            No.175 and distributed the booklet to its residents.
                            <br><br>In doing so, a resident aptly expressed, "Although we have been neighbors for years,
                            we
                            only know our own kitchens and bedrooms, and didn't have any knowledge of the entire house."
                            This medium not only deepened residents' comprehension of their individual lane houses but
                            also fostered a greater understanding among neighbors, transforming the communal dynamics
                            and enhancing the sense of shared space.
